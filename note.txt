Hi Rinn,

How are you doing :) I'm happy that you received my small gift from 347 miles apart! 
I know you must've been through busy days there. So I thought to send you something that cheers you up. When you open the box, you will find ...

And Ichiran Ramen (it's a heavy box, be careful! :) This is very famous when I went to Tokyo few years back. No Ramen is complete without Nori. So, you can enjoy ramen and nori. I know you love Matcha. After wake up in early morning, have a cup of Matcha to brighten you for the whole day.  ... 

I hope you are cheered up everytime you're having it. Because I really wanted to see you smile, rin. Your smile is the best thing I can see. Please take care there. I can't wait to see you again when you're back. 

Here is a small gift for you, hope you'd like it!
I know you may have some lowest days there and missed loved ones at home. 
So, I give these to make you feel home. 
Have a cup of Matcha to brighten you in early morning while breathing the fresh air of Boyolali.
And ramen. This is very famous when I went to Tokyo few years back. 
I hope you are cheered up everytime you're having it. 
I want to see you smile, cheerful Karina!
Hope you love it! 

Your cheer leader, 

Nuu
